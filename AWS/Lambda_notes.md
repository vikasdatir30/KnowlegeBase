**AWS Lambda**

    AWS Lambda is an event-driven serverless computing cloud service from Amazon Web Services that allows developers to program functions on a pay-per-use basis without creating, managing or paying for servers.
    
    AWS lambda also know as function-as-a-Service (FaaS).

    We just need to write our code and lambda function will automatically trigger execution by receiving some event. 

    We can write our code in python, java , c++, ruby or javascript.

    Aws lambda mostly use to deploy background task and not for any heavy applications of because of certain limitations.
